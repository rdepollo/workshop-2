Workshop 2 // Rob DePollo // CCS Winter 2018

This workshop was about using for loops to create geometric patterns. One of my designs is a simple black and white design that rotates at smaller sizes to look better on mobile devices. My other design allows you to draw your own patterns by cycling through different colors on a grid by clicking.
